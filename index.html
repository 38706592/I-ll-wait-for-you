Hello, I don't know if you opened this panel intentionally or not.
If you opened this by accident, please close this panel to avoid spoilers
much appreciated.

However, you opened this panel to look for answers directly instead of trying to solve the puzzle yourself
it is strongly not advised.

I hope you can take your time and enjoy this lore event, since this took a lot of time and effort to make.

However,
if you insist of digging deep into the codes for answers right away.
I hope you don't spoil the result to those who also take part of this lore event.

Thank you for your cooperation, happy lore hunting.
