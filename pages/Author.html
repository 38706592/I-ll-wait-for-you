            <p>Does... this counts as an Easter egg? Well, maybe I'll put whatever I want to say here then.</p>
            <p>This message is not related to the lore or the lore event itself. Not sure why you put that word in there, mayhaps you pressed F12 and stumbled upon this?</p>
            <p>Anyway, I hope this lore event can bring an unique and fun puzzle-solving experience to everyone, because coming up with these is not easy. If you all work together and reach the very end of this event, I would be very happy.</p>
            <p>Or maybe... we made this lot in hopes of this SMP to... not end too soon, like the last one.</p>
            <p>IPerhaps you're curious about who I am. Well, I'm a member in this SMP who doesn't interact much with you lot, mainly due to the language barrier.</p>
            <p>Pretty certain most of you would not expect that I coded this website for a lore event. As you can tell from this message, you can definitely see I absolutely suck at English.</p>
            <p>But hey, if you figured out who I am, try to DM me on Discord, I'll respond with a smiley face!</p>
